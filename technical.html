                    <h3>CAD service</h3>
                    <p>Projects often involve drawings, and drawings provided are not seldom too general for production. Generating production drawings is a very time consuming job and needs to be done by skilled people with understanding. Drawings are sometimes needed to confirm the final details before the stone is shaped and made to order. ISUP offers auto-CAD assistance by an experienced engineer working in this field for years.</p>

                    <p>Getting the prescription is one thing, breaking the specs and getting the order in another...
                        China supplies a wide range of materials, the stone world is like a labyrinth for outsiders thoughâ€¦ Being on the ground for 20 years, ISUP is very familiar with the production base, from quarry to port. ISUP can help you trace the right alternative and advice about the features of this alternative.

                    <h3>Production follow-up and or Quality Inspections</h3>
                    <p>Not every order is straight paving. Certain orders have to be right! Especially those involving bespoke items such as stairs, benches, planters, and so on. ISUP can follow-up the production of your orders and post inspectors in the factories, people who know the job, who can read plans, who have an eye for detail. At the end of production, ISUP inspectors can coordinate pre-shipment dry lay installation to make sure everything fits as planned. ISUP inspects bespoke orders with a range of check lists, covering all there is to cover to make your project a success.</p>
