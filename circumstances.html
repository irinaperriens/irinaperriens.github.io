                    <h3>Supply chain mapping</h3>
                    <p>To be successful as a stone supplier in China, a business needs to be able to communicate with foreign customers on one hand, and have a profound knowledge of the resources on the other hand. China is a huge country; it stretches from Siberia in the North to the Tropical South, bordering Vietnam and India. This leaves your business in the hands of trading companies who want to sell and export, but are reluctant to unveil the origin of the resources. 
                        Quarries are closed, other quarries open or reopen. Raw material resources often change,… raw material stocks can run out… For any serious business on the project market, understanding the supply chain is vital, but, when only working with suppliers it is extremely difficult to get full transparency. A third party can make a big difference.
                        ISUP spent a lot of time and effort in discovering the realities of the Chinese supply chains, and put them on the map. Knowing where things come from is the only way to be sure that you get what you asked for.

                    <h3>Factory Audits</h3>
                    <p id="circum_p"> We all try to do the right thing, but at the other side of the world, it is very difficult to know what really goes on, especially what your orders are concerned.
                        Even though there is no child labor in China, there are other concerns such as health & safety, salary levels, working hours,…
                        ISUP studied the national labor law, and that law is not too different from western labor laws. The question is to what extent the law is respected though. 
                        ISUP has performed many factory audits over the years to assure our customers that the life of the workers is worth living.  ISUP cooperates with producers to gradually improve conditions on the work floor.
